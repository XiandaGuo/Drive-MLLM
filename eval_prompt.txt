Task Description:
Analyze the provided image to identify all objects corresponding to the 'object_type' input variable. For each object detected, first determine its location within the image, and then delineate its boundaries using pixel coordinates. Sequentially label each object starting from 1.

Input Variable:
- 'object_type': {}

Output Markers:
- Start Marker: <PIXEL BOX START>
- End Marker: <PIXEL BOX END>

Mandatory Output Format:
<PIXEL BOX START>
object_type 1: (min_x1, min_y1, max_x1, max_y1)
object_type 2: (min_x2, min_y2, max_x2, max_y2)
...
<PIXEL BOX END>

Example:
If 'object_type' is set to 'vehicle' and two vehicles are detected in the image with coordinates (100, 150) to (200, 250) and (300, 350) to (400, 450), the output would be:
<PIXEL BOX START>
vehicle 1: (100, 150, 200, 250)
vehicle 2: (300, 350, 400, 450)
<PIXEL BOX END>

Procedure:
1. Locate: First, locate each object in the image that matches the specified 'object_type'.
2. Delineate: For each located object, identify its boundaries using pixel coordinates.
3. Label: Label each object sequentially as 'object_type 1', 'object_type 2', etc., based on their appearance order in the image.
4. Output: List all bounding boxes between the <PIXEL BOX START> and <PIXEL BOX END> markers, adhering strictly to the mandatory output format.
