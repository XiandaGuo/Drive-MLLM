Task Description:
In this task, the primary objective is to accurately identify and determine the bounding box coordinates for a specific object within an image. A bounding box is a rectangular box that can be defined by a set of coordinates [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y]. These coordinates correspond to the top-left corner (min_x, min_y) and the bottom-right corner (max_x, max_y) of the rectangle.

Question:
What is the bounding box of {} in the image?

Output Markers:
- Start Marker: <OUTPUT FORMAT START>
- End Marker: <OUTPUT FORMAT END>

Mandatory Output Format:
<OUTPUT FORMAT START>[min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y]<OUTPUT FORMAT END>
