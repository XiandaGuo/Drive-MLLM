Task Description:
This task involves calculating the Euclidean distance from a camera to a specific object within a scene. The formula used to determine this distance is: distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
How far is the camera from {}?
