Task Description:
In this task, you are required to determine whether one object is positioned behind another based on their z-values. The z-value indicates the depth position of an object, where a smaller z-value means the object is closer to the front. However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
Is {} behind {}?
