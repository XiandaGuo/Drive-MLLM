Task Description:
In this task, you are tasked with determining which of two specific objects is positioned further to the left based on their x-coordinates. Note that the smaller the x-coordinate, the closer the object is to the left. However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
Which is further left, {} or {}?

Output Markers:
