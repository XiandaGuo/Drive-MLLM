Task Description:
The task requires calculating the Euclidean distance between two specific objects located in a three-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance is computed using the formula: distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 + (z1 - z2)^2). However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
How far apart are {} and {}?
