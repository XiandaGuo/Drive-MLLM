Task Description:
The task involves calculating the horizontal distance between two specified objects, which is defined as the absolute difference in their x-coordinates. The formula used for this calculation is |x1 - x2|. However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
What is the horizontal distance between {} and {}?

Output Markers:
- Start Marker: <OUTPUT FORMAT START>
- End Marker: <OUTPUT FORMAT END>

Mandatory Output Format:
<OUTPUT FORMAT START>distance<OUTPUT FORMAT END>

(Assuming the coordinates for the lamp are (10.3, 4.2, 5.1) and the sofa  are (1.1, 8.7, 3.9))
Example:
Question: "What is the horizontal distance between the lamp and the sofa?"
Answer: <OUTPUT FORMAT START>9.2<OUTPUT FORMAT END>
