Task Description:
The task involves calculating the horizontal distance between two specified objects, which is defined as the absolute difference in their x-coordinates. The formula used for this calculation is |x1 - x2|. However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
What is the horizontal distance between {} and {}?
