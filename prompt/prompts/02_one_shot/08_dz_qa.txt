Task Description:
This task requires calculating the vertical distance from the camera to a specified object based on the object's z-coordinate. However, the coordinates of the objects will not be provided directly; you must infer or identify them yourself.

Question:
What is the camera's vertical distance from {}?

Output Markers:
- Start Marker: <OUTPUT FORMAT START>
- End Marker: <OUTPUT FORMAT END>

Mandatory Output Format:
<OUTPUT FORMAT START>distance<OUTPUT FORMAT END>

(Assuming the coordinates for the toy are (4.5, 6.7, 1.3))
Example:
